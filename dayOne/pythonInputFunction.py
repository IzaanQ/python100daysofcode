input("What is your name")

# The Input Function is an embedded function in the Python language memory that displays to the console a prompt that is predetermined by the 
# writer, which then is able to accept a user value via the console. Data that is entered by the user is passed back to the original input
# function. The original Input Function is replaced with the value that the user send back via the console. 

print("Hello " + input("What is your name"))
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))
print("Hello " + input("What is your name? "))

# The code is read from inside-out, reading each sucessive layer, like an onion. Each layer is an instruction.
