# There are naming rules that you should follow, to make your code readable
# Make sure that your code makes sense for you

username =/= user name
username -> user_name

# Use underscores to separate words in place of spaces

# Reserved words should not be used for variable naming

# e.g. input, print, len etc.

# A NameError appears when you make a variable naming/calling mistake
